# Day of the Programmer Hackathon!

The **Day of the Programmer** is an international professional day that is celebrated on the 256th (hexadecimal 0x100,
or 2<sup>8</sup>th)
day of each year.

This day is possible thanks to the community feeling we all have, sharing an improving as a whole. A community which
does not stop sharing content and helping to each other!

So to keep promoting this feeling and good vibes on the community, we are creating this
[hackathon](https://diadelaprogramacion.com/) with just a main objective: **To help the community!**

> This hackathon is a collaboration between [MoureDev](https://www.twitch.tv/mouredev) and
> [Rviewer](https://rviewer.io). He will review and give feedback to some proposed solutions from the community at the
> end of the Hackathon üòª

## Functional requirements

As we said, the premise of this hackathon is quite easy ü´£ You just have to create **an application (web or mobile)
through which you add value to the community.**

### What does it mean?

* You can choose a niche or implement something for the whole dev community. Provide value to people who are starting on
  this world, or people who have +10 years of experience, or just people interested in some technologies, or finding a
  job around the globe, etc... are just ideas! Just delight us with yours! ü§©

* Your application should have a [product tour](https://userguiding.com/blog/product-tour/). Some mechanism through your
  users understand and know all the features easily the first time they see it! If you want to fall in love with the
  community, you have to make it easy for them...

* Your application has to allow to be used without a signup. You can implement one if some of your features requires it
  but again, you have to make it easy for the community!

* There is no constraint over the language or framework. Choose whatever you want!

* Last but not least! Your application have to be available somehow. If you develop a web application, you can use
  [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or something similar to deploy it. If you have created a mobile app, just provide an APK
  to be installed easily.

## Technical requirements

* Create a **clean**, **maintainable** and **well-designed** code. We expect to see a good and clear architecture that
  allows to add or modify the solution without so much troubles.
* **Test** your code until you are comfortable with it. We don't expect a 100% of Code Coverage but some tests that
  helps to have a more stable and confident base code.

To understand how you take decisions during the implementation, **please write a COMMENTS.md** file explaining some of
the most important parts of the application. You would also be able to defend your code through
[Rviewer](https://rviewer.io), once you submit your solution.

---

## How to submit your solution

* Push your code to the `devel` branch - we encourage you to commit regularly to show your thinking process was.
* **Create a new Pull Request** to `main` branch & **merge it**.

Once merged you **won't be able to change or add** anything to your solution, so double-check that everything is as you
expected!

Remember that **there is no countdown**, so take your time and implement a solution that you are proud!
